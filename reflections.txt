Storing or pushing objects in an array?
    - We can't push any variable in an array if it is not already defined.
      The same goes with objects, if an object is not defined prior to push
      then error is encountered.

Splice method required fields?
    -  splice(index, how_many, value1, value2...)
        index ->required
        how_many ->not required
        value1, value2,... ->not required

for-in loop?
    -  loops over all the properties of object
            for(var property1 in object){
                return property1;
            }
            eg: var object = {num:123, name:"vibha"};
                for(var property1 in object){
                    return property1;
                }
                o/p ->
                    "123"
                    "vibha"

forEach loop?
    -  always has function in it's argument.
        arr.forEach(function(value, index){
            //tasks
        });

Arrays are object too. Since typeof array is returned as object. But don't use computations 
of objects on Arrays. To know more refer https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp
